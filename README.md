ðŸŽ¨ The power of pure CSS transitions in action!
Just completed this Team Card Design using only HTML & CSS - no JavaScript needed!
âœ¨ What makes it special:

Smooth hover animations with CSS transitions
Card lift effects using transform properties
Color transitions that feel natural
Responsive design with pure CSS
Clean, semantic HTML structure

Sometimes the simplest solutions are the most elegant. Proving that you don't always need JavaScript for beautiful interactions!
